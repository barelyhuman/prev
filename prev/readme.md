The CLI has basically 3 functions,

1. Create a Server based on the Kernel([HonoJS](https://hono.dev))
2. Allow live reloading if the `--dev` flag is passed.

```sh
npx @barelyhuman/prev ./path/to/root-of-project
npx @barelyhuman/prev --dev ./path/to/root-of-project
```

3. Inject Plugins, you can add in simple plugins to improve the DX like adding
   one for goober/twind for css-in-js. Or even postcss to add in something like
